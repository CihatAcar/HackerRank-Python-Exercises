"""Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands: `
insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.

Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands
where each command will be of the 7 types listed above.
Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

Sample Input:
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
insert 0 6
print
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort
print
pop
reverse
print

Sample Output:
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]
